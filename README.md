## Introduction

The OnDeck Remote Conference project is designed to address the challenges of hosting conferences in a remote and distributed environment. Traditional in-person conferences offer unique opportunities for networking, learning, and collaboration, but remote conferences often lack the same level of engagement. This project seeks to bridge that gap by providing a comprehensive platform that facilitates interaction among participants, speakers, sponsors, and organizers.

## Features

- **Virtual Auditorium:** Attendees can join live sessions, watch presentations, and participate in Q&A sessions.

- **Networking Lounge:** A dedicated space for attendees to connect with each other through video chats, text-based conversations, and virtual business card exchanges.

- **Exhibition Hall:** Sponsors can set up virtual booths showcasing their products and services, with interactive demos and direct interaction with attendees.

- **Workshops and Breakout Rooms:** Host parallel workshops and breakout sessions, allowing attendees to choose topics of interest and engage in smaller group discussions.

- **Resource Center:** A repository for conference materials, including presentation slides, research papers, and additional resources.

- **Schedule and Reminders:** Display the conference schedule, send notifications, and allow attendees to set up personal agendas.
